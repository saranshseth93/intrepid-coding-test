# Frontend Test

You are tasked with creating a web page based on the provided design found in src/assets/travel-with-confidence-design.png. The final product should closely resemble the design provided and should demonstrate your proficiency in front-end web development and utilising a design system. Additionally, implementing this in TypeScript will earn you bonus points.

Evaluation Criteria:

- **Accuracy**: How closely your implementation matches the provided design.
- **Code Quality**: The cleanliness, organization, and readability of your code.
- **Responsiveness**: How well your web page adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Design System**: The extent to which you utilise a design system approach.
- **Creativity**: Any additional creative touches or improvements beyond the basic requirements.
- **TypeScript (Bonus)**: If TypeScript is used, its correctness and usefulness in enhancing code quality.

## Project Overview

This project was an in-depth exercise in frontend development, aimed at crafting a responsive and visually engaging web page. By leveraging the power of Vue.js and TypeScript, the initiative was to precisely mirror a designated design, ensuring the page's adaptability and functionality across a variety of devices.

## Technical Highlights

### Vue.js and TypeScript

- **Framework and Language Synergy**: Built upon Vue.js for its reactive and component-based architecture, enhanced by TypeScript's static typing, this setup facilitated a robust, less error-prone codebase.
- **Component Modularity**: The development emphasized reusability and scalability within component architecture, including feature cards, a navigational header, and buttons, all designed to be highly reusable and adaptable to various contexts.

### Responsive Design and Design System

- **Adaptive Interface**: A strong focus was placed on responsive design principles to ensure the webpage fluidly adjusts to different screen sizes and resolutions, maintaining the integrity of the user experience and design.
- **Design System Implementation**: The project employs a design system approach, utilizing a consistent set of design tokens and guidelines. This system underpins the visual and functional coherence across the site, ensuring components follow a unified style and behavior pattern.

### Creativity and Interactivity

- **Image Zoom Effect**: An interactive zoom effect on images, triggered on hover, was introduced to captivate user attention and add a layer of dynamism.
- **Button Color Invert Effect**: Buttons on the page were designed to feature a smooth color invert effect upon hover, enhancing the interactive experience and visual feedback for users.

### Code Quality and Component Reusability

- **ESLint Compliance**: Adherence to stringent coding standards was maintained throughout the project, confirmed by passing all ESLint checks, promoting high code quality, maintainability, and readability.
- **Reusable Components**: A cornerstone of the project was the emphasis on creating reusable components, in alignment with the design system principles. This not only facilitated a streamlined development process but also ensures ease of future enhancements and consistency across the application.
